    \end{itemize}

    \item Given a list, fold takes as arguments a function $g$ (that
      takes two arguments) and an initial value (an accumulator)
    \item $g$ is first applied to the initial value and the first
      item in the list

    \item Imposing the key-value structure on arbitrary datasets\footnote{There's more about it: here we only look at the input to the map function.}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item E.g.: for a collection of Web pages, input keys may be URLs
        and values may be the HTML content
      \end{itemize}
    \item In some algorithms, input keys are not used, in others they

    \item The mapper is applied to every input key-value pair to

      the key
    \item No ordering is guaranteed across reducers

  \item \textbf{Output keys from reducers are written back to the
      distributed filesystem\footnote{This is true for Hadoop MapReduce. Apache Spark instead keeps in memory intermediate data.}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The output may consist of $r$ distinct files, where $r$ is
      the number of reducers
    \item Such output may be the input to a subsequent phase\footnote{Think of \textbf{iterative algorithms}.}

    \item They are ``spilled'' to the local disk of each machine in
      the cluster
