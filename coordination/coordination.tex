		\item The priest follows a well known protocol to reach a consensus:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Priest: Alice, will you marry Bob ?
			\item Alice: yes
			\item Priest: Bob, will you marry Alice ?
			\item Bob: yes
			\item Priest: You are now husband and wife
		\end{enumerate}

		\vspace{10pt}

		\item In distributed systems this becomes:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Coordinator: Alice, can you commit key X with value 5 ?
			\item Alice: yes, I can
			\item Coordinator: Bob, can you commit key X with value 5 ?
			\item Bob: yes, I can
			\item Coordinator: Ok, both of you record that X has now a value of 5
		\end{enumerate}

	An infinite number of messages is needed for each general to be sure the other agrees on the time of the attack.
