	abstract="The Distributed Consensus problem involves n processors each of which holds an initial binary value. At most t processors may be faulty and ignore any protocol (even behaving maliciously), yet it is required that the non faulty processors eventually agree on a value that was initially held by one of them. We measure the quality of a consensus protocol using the following parameters; total number of processors n, number of rounds of message exchange r, and maximal message size m. The known lower bounds are respectively 3t + 1,t + 1, and 1.",

	abstract = {The Distributed Computing Column covers the theory of systems that are composed of a number of interacting computing elements. These include problems of communication and networking, databases, distributed shared memory, multiprocessor architectures, operating systems, verification internet, and the {web.This} issue consists of four parts:• a survey of {SIROCCO}'01 by Pierre Fraigniaud,• a survey of {POMC}'01 by Rui Fan,• a survey of {PODC}'01 by myself,• the paper "Paxos Made Simple" by Leslie {Lamport.This} year was the 20-th anniversary of {PODC}, and included a special celebration honoring the work of Leslie Lamport, on the occasion of his 60th birthday, and was collocated with the Workshop on Principles of Mobile Computing ({POMC}). I briefly describe the {PODC} conference, and reproduce the toast by Fred Schneider in the honor of Leslie. The Business Meeting report is by Gil Neiger. Finally, there is Leslie's paper on his own algorithm which was discussed in a few of the {PODC} lectures. I am very grateful to the many people contributing to this issue.},
