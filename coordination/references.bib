	abstract="TheDistributed Consensus problem involvesn processors each of which holds an initial binary value. At mostt processors may be faulty and ignore any protocol (even behaving maliciously), yet it is required that the nonfaulty processors eventually agree on a value that was initially held by one of them. We measure the quality of a consensus protocol using the following parameters; total number of processorsn, number of rounds of message exchanger, and maximal message sizem. The known lower bounds are respectively 3t + 1,t + 1, and 1.",
